## Risk Assessments

A risk assessment works to determine the systems that are the most critical to the business

- Transfer the risk (such as purchasing insurance)
- Accept the risk (a decision that is made to not spend any resources as the impact would be low and the cost too high)
- Mitigate the risk (apply security and other controls to protect the asset and reduce the risk)
- Avoid the risk (an asset that is at too high a risk may simply be taken offline so it canâ€™t be exploited)
