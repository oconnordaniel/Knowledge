Prepare the Environment

Host:
Always use a machine or VM that is for the sole purpose of handling malware. 
    - Bare Metal
    - VM - Windows 10
    - VM - Windows 11
    - VM - Windows Server 2019
    - VM - Windows Server 2022
    - VM - Linux https://docs.remnux.org/

1. Create a "Clean Room" OS. 
2. Baseline the activity on the OS. 
3. Setup Host Monitoring; Sysmon, Procmon, ProcExplorer or Regshot, etc. Then filter out everything in the baseline.
4. Network Monitoring; Wireshark, tcpdump, etc.
5. Control over the network. Dummy DNS server and Proxy
6. A mechanism to move analysis logs and malware samples in and out of the Virtual Machine without compromising the host (Be careful with this one. If you have a shared directory with your malware analysis VM that remains accessible when running malware, you might risk malware affecting all files in your shared directory)


Network: 
Network should be disconnected or monitored. 
Host isolation and packet capture.

## Storage and Transport
