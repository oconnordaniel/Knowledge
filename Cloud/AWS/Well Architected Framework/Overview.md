# Overview

[White paper](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/welcome.html)

## Pillars

- **[[Operational]]** - Run and monitor systems
- **[[Security]]** - Protect data and systems. Mitigate risk
- **[[Reliability]]** - Mitigate and recover from disruptions
- **[[Performance]]** - Use resources effectively
- **[[Cost]]** - Get the lowest price

## General Design Principles

- Don't guess costs
- Easy test systems and prod. scale
- Automate to make architectural changes and tests easier
- Allow for evolution - CI/CD, Rapid releases, deprecating functions
- Data driven architecture
- Improve though game day - simulated disaster
