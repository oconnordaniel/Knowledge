## Planning

1. From the scope and the final state down, define all the tasks and subtasks down. (Usually in a format like 1.1.1 1.1.2 1.2.1 )

2. From the list of task, ignore parent tasks and look solely at the child tasks. Then for each task, identify all the dependencies of that task.

3. Make a timeline and identify all the path of the project based on dependences.
    Identify if there's a critical path for which all work may be halted by.

4. Identify resources needed for each unit task.
    Every task should have a Leader. That leader is responsible for that task. That task can have other people involved. Get weigh in from the task leader on needed resources and time lines.

5. Identify risks.
    Determine probably times impact to get a score. Then determine if it can be mitigated or ignored.
    1. For the project as a whole, identify risk,
    2. For each task, identify risks.

6. If sensible, ensure tasks are added for control loop.

7. If sensible, ensure all tasks have sub-tasks to test the results of the task.

8. Present plan to stakeholders.
